## What I Learned

- Practiced adding functionality to existing codebase
- More familiarity with implementing a service worker
- Refreshed knowledge on Heroku deployment and setting up MongoDB Atlas server
- How to configure IndexedDB for offline storage

## Built With

- express - server
- mongoose - SQL database architecture
